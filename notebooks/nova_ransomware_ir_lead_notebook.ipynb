    "> It helps me (1) clarify what “Nova ransomware” is, (2) list the log sources & artifacts I expect to see, and (3) run a repeatable IR plan playbook and basic log triage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I use this**  \n",
    "- I paste/attach exported logs (CSV/JSON) from my SIEM/XDR here.  \n",
    "- I run the triage cells to quickly scope: *initial access → privilege escalation → lateral movement → ransomware execution → impact*.  \n",
    "- I capture decisions, timestamps, and evidence references for the post-incident report.\n"

    "## 1) What “Nova ransomware” refers to (working definition)\n",
    "\n",
    "In public reporting, **Nova** is commonly described as a **ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)** operation that emerged in **2025** and is linked to / rebranded from **RALord**. The payload has been reported as a **Rust executable** that encrypts files and drops a ransom note, and campaigns commonly include **double extortion** (encryption + data theft / leak-site pressure).\n",
    "\n",
    "**IR-relevant characteristics I should expect to validate in my environment**\n",
    "- **File extensions** added to encrypted files (several variants have been reported across sources):  \n",
    "  - `.ralord`  \n",
    "  - `.<orig_ext>.LORD`  \n",
    "  - `.<orig_ext>.README-Nova`  \n",
    "  - `.<orig_ext>.RNOVA`\n",
    "- **Ransom note**: may instruct contact via chat/IM identifiers (e.g., qTox / Session / Telegram handles), and may not state a fixed ransom amount.\n",
    "- **Operator workflow**: typical modern ransomware chain (initial access → discovery → credential access → lateral movement → defense evasion → data staging/exfil → encryption).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note to self**: “Nova” is also used as a name by unrelated malware families in other contexts (e.g., stealers). I must confirm the artifacts match *this* ransomware cluster before I label the incident.\n"

    "1. Declare incident, start **incident log** (timestamps, decisions, who/what/when).  \n",
    "2. **Isolate** suspected hosts (EDR network containment or VLAN quarantine).  \n",
    "3. Preserve volatile evidence:\n",
    "   - running processes, network connections, logged-on users\n",
    "   - memory capture for key hosts (if feasible)\n",
    "4. Confirm impact:\n",
    "   - what is encrypted? endpoints vs file servers vs hypervisors?\n",
    "   - is there a ransom note? what extension changes?\n",
    "5. Decide on **containment boundary**:\n",
    "   - block suspected C2/exfil destinations\n",
    "   - restrict admin tools (PSExec/WMI), disable RDP if needed\n",
    "6. Notify legal/comms/privacy; start regulatory clock if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase B — Scope & Root Cause (same day)\n",
    "1. Find **patient zero** and initial access path:\n",
    "   - phishing? exposed VPN/RDP? stolen creds? supply chain?\n",
    "2. Determine if data exfil likely occurred:\n",
    "   - large outbound transfers, staging directories, cloud uploads\n",
    "3. Identify the attacker’s footholds:\n",
    "   - persistence, new users, scheduled tasks, services\n",
    "4. Build a timeline: initial access → privilege escalation → lateral movement → encryption start.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase C — Eradication\n",
    "1. Remove persistence, reset credentials (tiered), rotate secrets/keys.  \n",
    "2. Patch exploited surfaces and harden remote access.  \n",
    "3. Reimage/restore compromised endpoints (prefer rebuild over “clean”).  \n",
    "4. Validate that EDR policy prevents re-execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase D — Recovery\n",
    "1. Restore from known-good backups (offline/immutable preferred).  \n",
    "2. Validate integrity before reconnecting to production network.  \n",
    "3. Monitor for reinfection (heightened detection rules 2–4 weeks).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase E — Lessons Learned\n",
    "- What control failed? logging gaps? backup gaps? IAM gaps?\n",
